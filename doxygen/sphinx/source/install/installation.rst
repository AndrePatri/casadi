Installation 
==============

Pip
---

The preferred way to install the alpaqa Python interface is using pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    python3 -m pip install alpaqa

(`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/alpaqa>`_)

To compile problems using the Python interface, you will need a C compiler, such
as GCC or Clang on Linux and MSVC on Windows.

From source
-----------

Building alpaqa from source requires the installation of some C++ dependencies, 
see `Installation (Doxygen) <../../Doxygen/installation.html>`_ for detailed
instructions.
